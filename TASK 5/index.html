      <p>
        Ada Lovelace was a brilliant mathematician and writer known for her work on Charles Babbageâ€™s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is often regarded as the world's first computer programmer because she recognized that the machine could be used to manipulate symbols and not just numbers.

        I admire Ada Lovelace for her vision, courage, and intelligence in a time when women had very limited access to science and education. She paved the way for generations of women in technology.
